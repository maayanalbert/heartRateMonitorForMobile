# heartRateMonitorForMobile
A heart rate monitor created using processing for android. This was also quantified using a combination of peak finding, standard deviation filtering, and zero crossing.   My principal data point was the brightness from the camera input, comprised of the color value of every 20th pixel. I kept and updated a list of the last 100 brightness points. This was used to compute the mean, which served as the zero crossing point. I also used this data set to compute the standard deviation.  To calculate the beats per minute, I kept track of the time difference in milliseconds between each heart beat. I then averaged out the most recent differences and divided the number of milliseconds in a minute by that value.
